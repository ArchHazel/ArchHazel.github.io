I am currently pursuing M.S. in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, under the supervision of Prof. Xin Li and Prof. Wenping Wang. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the Faculty of Dentistry, the University of Hong Kong, working with Postdoctoral Fellow Congyi Zhang and Prof. Lifeng Zhu. Prior to that, I earned my B.Eng. degree from the School of Instrument Science and Engineering at Southeast University.
