    title: 'Approximate Expectation Propagation Massive MIMO Detector With Weighted Neumann-Series',
    abstract: `In this brief, a weighted Neumann series approximation (wNSA) is 
    first proposed for explicit inverse matrix approximation, which attains 
    enhanced convergence rate and accuracy compared to standard NSA for various 
    MIMO antenna configurations. wNSA is then combined with EPA to propose an 
    efficient, flexible, and hardware-friendly EPA-wNSA detector.`,
